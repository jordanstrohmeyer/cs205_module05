Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty began to fall
Contrary to myth, he stopped his fall and climbed with his all
Saving himself from inevitable death
Humpty stood up on the wall to catch his breath
But low and behold, he met the same fate
As he found himself in the middle of two feuding farmers fiery with hate
The two grew vegetables, and with those they waged war
Humpty dogdged a cabbage, but soon there was more
struck by a carrot to the heart, he sank in defeat
"What a terrible fate" he cried "what a horrible way to die"
He gazed at the farmers and told them to lie
"When they ask what became of Humpty and his eggish jawl
Please just tell them I fell off the wall"
